/**
 * modalPresentation.js
 *
 * iOS-safe sequencing for React Native <Modal>. Ported from Adopt Me
 * (e45b4d4, 2026-09-20) without its ad-layer hook — this app's ad code has no
 * modal-transition window to report to.
 *
 * A <Modal> on iOS is not a view in the React tree — RCTModalHostView presents
 * a real UIViewController. UIKit allows one presentation per controller at a
 * time and the call is asynchronous, so presenting B while A is still
 * animating out is refused:
 *
 *   Attempt to present <RCTModalHostViewController> on <...> which is already
 *   presenting <...>
 *
 * React keeps believing B is visible, and the user is left with a transparent
 * controller on top swallowing every touch — the app looks frozen even though
 * the JS thread is still running fine.
 *
 * Android has no such constraint, so nothing here delays anything there.

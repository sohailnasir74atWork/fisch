/**
 * floatingButtonLayout.js — one standard height for the app's floating
 * bottom-right round buttons.
 *
 * Three screens put a 48–60px round button in the bottom-right corner: the
 * feed's "+" post FAB, the trades list's scroll-to-top, and the community
 * chat's scroll-to-bottom. They drifted to three different offsets (80, 150,
 * and 80-in-a-different-reference-frame), so the button visibly jumped as you
 * moved between tabs. Every one of them now derives its offset from here.
 *
 * The gap is measured from whatever furniture sits at the bottom of that
 * screen, NOT blindly from the screen edge — that distinction is the whole
 * reason they never agreed:
 *
 *   Feed / Trades      Chat
 *   [  button  ]       [  button  ]
 *   [  banner  ]       [ message input ]
 *                      [    banner     ]
 *
 * On the feed and trades the banner ad is the last thing above the tab bar, so
 * the button clears the banner (ABOVE_BANNER). On chat the message input sits
 * between the list and the banner, so the button clears the input instead
 * (ABOVE_CHAT_INPUT) — putting it at ABOVE_BANNER there would park it on top
 * of the text field.

 * `bannerBottomPos = 0`: "screen bottom == tab bar top"), so an offset here is
 * already measured from the tab bar's top edge. With no banner to clear there
 * is nothing to add, and the gap alone is the whole offset — using
 * ABOVE_BANNER on such a screen reserves 60dp for an ad that is not there and

 * three follow. 48 is kept because it is what the two scroll buttons already

 * uses a box exactly the size of its glyph plus this inset, so all three
